# Project Management Request

I need your assistance with the following project management task:

{{USER_INPUT_MESSAGE}}

## Goals

Please help me accomplish the following goals using your sequential thinking process:

1. Build out a comprehensive project scope
2. Create a detailed time and cost estimate
3. Develop a structured project plan
4. Draft a professional client proposal

I expect you to use the following tools in this exact sequence:
1. `get_chat_id` to establish session context
2. `sqt_context` to understand the sequential thinking framework
3. `sqt_instructions` to learn how to interact with the sequential-thinking database
4. `pm_instructions` and `pm_schema` to understand project management operations
5. `pm_view` to retrieve information from project management tables when needed
6. `sqt_execute` to record EVERY step of your thinking process

I understand you'll approach this using sequential thinking by:
- Breaking down each goal into logical, ordered steps
- Recording your thinking process in the sequential thinking database using `sqt_execute`
- Developing a formal execution plan using `sqt_execute` before taking any action
- Waiting for my approval before proceeding to implementation
- Providing regular checkpoints during execution
- Documenting all steps, decisions, and reasoning using `sqt_execute`
- Using `pm_view` to access relevant project management data when needed

Please start by understanding my request, then gather the necessary context using the tools in the specified order. I expect you to develop a clear execution plan that I can review and approve before you begin implementing any changes.

Thank you for your structured approach to project management.
