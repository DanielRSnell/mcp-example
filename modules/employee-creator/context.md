# Employee Creator Framework

## Overview

The Employee Creator Framework is a system for creating and managing virtual employees with specialized functions and standard operating procedures (SOPs). Each employee represents a role with specific capabilities and detailed step-by-step processes for accomplishing tasks. This framework allows organizations to standardize workflows, maintain consistent processes, and delegate specific responsibilities to virtual employees with defined expertise.

## When to Use the Employee Creator Framework

- Creating standardized roles with specific functions within an organization
- Defining detailed SOPs for common business processes
- Establishing consistent workflows across teams or departments
- Delegating specialized tasks to virtual employees with specific expertise
- Ensuring compliance with organizational policies and procedures
- Maintaining institutional knowledge through documented processes
- Training new team members on standard procedures
- Scaling operations while maintaining quality and consistency
- Tracking task progress and maintaining context across user sessions

## Key Features of the Employee Creator Framework

- **Organization-Based**: Employees belong to specific organizations with unique organization_ids
- **Access Control**: Each employee has an access_list of user_ids that can utilize their capabilities
- **Tool Access**: Employees have registered tools they can access with instructions on how to use them
- **Role-Based**: Employees have defined roles (e.g., Project Manager, Customer Support)
- **Function-Specific**: Each employee specializes in particular functions within their role
- **Process-Driven**: Detailed SOPs guide employees through each task
- **Sequential Thinking**: Employees use structured thinking processes to accomplish tasks
- **Task Logging**: Comprehensive logging of task progress with user context
- **Context Persistence**: Metadata storage for maintaining state across sessions
- **Adaptable**: Processes can be updated and refined over time
- **Scalable**: New employees can be created for additional roles as needed
- **Consistent**: Standardized approaches ensure reliable outcomes

- **actions**: Specific actions to take during this step
- **tools**: Specific tools to use during this step
- **expected_outcome**: What should be achieved after this step
- **next_step**: Reference to the next step in the sequence

## Task Log Structure

Each task log entry includes:

- **log_id**: Unique identifier for the log entry
- **task_id**: Unique identifier for the task
- **employee_id**: The employee performing the task
- **user_id**: The user the task is being performed for
- **function_id**: The function being performed
- **sop_id**: The SOP being followed
- **current_step_id**: The current step in the process
- **status**: Current status of the task (started, in_progress, completed, paused, cancelled)
- **completion_flag**: Boolean indicating if the task is complete
- **progress_percentage**: Numerical representation of task completion (0-100)
- **started_at**: When the task was started
- **updated_at**: When the task was last updated
- **completed_at**: When the task was completed (if applicable)
- **notes**: Additional notes about the task progress
- **metadata_id**: Reference to the metadata for this task

## Metadata Structure

Each metadata record includes:

- **metadata_id**: Unique identifier for the metadata
- **task_id**: The task this metadata relates to
- **user_id**: The user this metadata relates to
- **content**: JSONB field containing context-specific data
- **created_at**: When the metadata was created
- **updated_at**: When the metadata was last updated

## Employee Creation Process

Creating a new employee involves:

1. **Define Basic Information**: Name, organization_id, access_list, role
2. **Configure Tool Access**: Specify which tools the employee can access and use
3. **Identify Functions**: List all functions the employee will perform
4. **Create SOPs**: Develop detailed procedures for each function
5. **Break Down Steps**: Define sequential steps for each SOP
6. **Detail Actions**: Specify questions, actions, and tools for each step
7. **Review and Refine**: Ensure all processes are complete and accurate
8. **Activate Employee**: Set the employee status to active

## Using Employees

When using an employee:

1. **Verify Access**: Ensure the user_id is in the employee's access_list
2. **Select Function**: Choose the specific function to perform
3. **Prepare Tools**: Ensure all required tools are available based on tool_access
4. **Create Task Log**: Initialize a task log entry for the user and function
5. **Initialize Metadata**: Create metadata record for task context
6. **Follow SOP**: Work through the steps in the appropriate SOP
7. **Use Tools**: Utilize the specified tools according to the instructions
8. **Update Task Log**: Record progress after each step
9. **Update Metadata**: Maintain context as the task progresses
10. **Document Actions**: Record actions taken and outcomes
11. **Complete Process**: Mark task as complete when all steps are finished

## Task Continuity

The task logging and metadata system enables:

1. **Session Persistence**: Users can pause and resume tasks across multiple sessions
2. **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into which step of which SOP is currently active
3. **Context Retention**: Metadata maintains specific context about the task state
4. **User History**: Historical record of all tasks performed for a user
5. **Multi-tasking**: Users can have multiple concurrent tasks with different employees
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all actions taken during task execution
7. **Analytics**: Insights into task completion rates, time spent, and common issues

## Best Practices

1. Be specific about employee roles and functions
2. Create detailed, step-by-step SOPs for each function
3. Include specific questions to ask at each step
4. Define clear actions to take at each step
5. Specify which tools to use and how to use them at each step
6. Establish expected outcomes for each step
7. Maintain version control for SOPs as they evolve
8. Regularly review and update procedures
9. Ensure organization_id, access_list, and tool_access are properly maintained
10. Document the reasoning behind each procedure
11. Update task logs after each significant action
12. Store relevant context in metadata for task continuity
13. Design metadata schema to facilitate easy resumption of tasks
14. Collect feedback to improve processes over time

## Implementation Note

In the database, all tables and functions are prefixed with "emp_" (Employee Creator) to avoid naming conflicts. For example, employees are stored in the `emp_employees` table, SOPs in the `emp_sops` table, task logs in the `emp_task_logs` table, and metadata in the `emp_metadata` table.

When using the database functions, remember to include the "emp_" prefix (e.g., `emp_create_employee()`, `emp_get_sop()`, `emp_create_task_log()`, `emp_update_metadata()`) and use `organization_id`, `access_list`, and `tool_access` to maintain proper access control and functionality.

The database schema uses snake_case for field names (e.g., `employee_id`, `organization_id`, `tool_access`, `metadata_id`), while this document uses camelCase (e.g., `employeeId`, `organizationId`, `toolAccess`, `metadataId`) for conceptual clarity.
